# ML Project Deployment

This project demonstrates how to deploy machine learning models using Python, covering the full workflow from model training to deployment in a production-ready environment.

## Overview

The repository provides code and examples for preparing, saving, and deploying machine learning models, making it easier for data scientists and engineers to operationalize ML solutions. It is suitable for those interested in productionizing ML workflows and integrating models into real-world applications.

## Features

- Model training and evaluation in Python
- Model serialization and export (e.g., using pickle, joblib, or ONNX)
- Deployment scripts and examples (e.g., Flask, FastAPI, or similar frameworks)
- Guidance on API creation for ML models

## Tools Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for modeling and deployment scripts
- **Scikit-learn** or similar ML libraries: Model building and evaluation
- **Flask**, **FastAPI**, or **Streamlit**: For creating web APIs or interfaces for deployed models
- **Pickle**, **joblib**, or **ONNX**: Model serialization and export
- **Docker** (optional): Containerization for production deployment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/utkarsh884/ML-project-deployment.git
cd ML-project-deployment
```

Install dependencies (if a `requirements.txt` file is provided):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Otherwise, install dependencies as specified in the project files.

### Usage

1. Train and save your machine learning model using the provided scripts.
2. Deploy the saved model using the API/server scripts (e.g., Flask/FastAPI app).
3. Interact with the deployed model via REST API or web interface.

## Project Structure

- `model/` – Scripts for training and saving ML models
- `deployment/` – API and deployment scripts
